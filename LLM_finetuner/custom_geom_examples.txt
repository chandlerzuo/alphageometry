A square sheet of paper ABCD is so folded that B falls on the mid point M of CD. Prove that the crease will divide BC in the ratio 5:3. 
# Define triangle F G H such right angle at G, and FG+FH=2HG & Pythagoras; wlog HG=1; then find ratio GF/FH
# Let R be the point on line GF at equal distance from F as H.
# Let V be the point on line GF at equal distance from G as H.
# Then V is the midpoint of GR
F G H = triangle F G H; R = eqdistance R F F H, on_line R F G; eqdistance V G G H, on_line V G F, midpoint V G R; todo:ratio 5/3
